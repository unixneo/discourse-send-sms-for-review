# discourse-send-sms-for-review

A Discourse plugin that sends an SMS via the OpenPhone API when a newly created post is immediately placed into the moderation review queue.

Designed for low-traffic sites where urgent moderation needs can justify SMS alerts, but with strict time gating to avoid noise and overnight interruptions.

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Listens for `:post_created` events
- Checks if the post is immediately associated with a `Reviewable` (e.g., queued post, flagged post)
- Sends an SMS via OpenPhone with the topic title
- Supports local time windows (e.g., only alert between 08:00 and 21:00)
- Time zone fully configurable using IANA zone names (e.g., `Asia/Bangkok`)
- All behavior and logging controlled via admin settings
- Fails silently and logs clearly
